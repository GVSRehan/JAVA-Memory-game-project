Memory Game
Overview
The Memory Game is a Java Swing-based desktop application that provides an interactive experience for players to test their memory skills. The game presents players with a grid of concealed images, and their objective is to match pairs of identical images by uncovering them one at a time. The game features a graphical user interface with vibrant visuals and intuitive controls.

Features
Dynamic Grid: The game generates a customizable grid of images based on the specified size, providing flexibility for players to choose their preferred difficulty level.
Timer: A built-in timer adds a competitive element to the game, challenging players to complete matches within a set time limit.
Tries Counter: Players are allotted a limited number of tries to complete the game, adding strategic depth and encouraging efficient decision-making.
Win/Lose Dialogs: Informative dialog boxes notify players of their game outcome, whether they emerge victorious by successfully matching all pairs or fall short of completing the game within the allotted tries.
How to Play
Launch the Game: Execute the Main class to start the Memory Game application.
Game Interface: Upon launching, players are presented with a grid of concealed images and a counter indicating the number of tries remaining.
Matching Images: Click on two concealed images consecutively to reveal them. If the images match, they remain uncovered; otherwise, they are concealed again, and a try is deducted.
Game Outcome: The game concludes when all pairs of images are successfully matched, resulting in a win, or when the player exhausts all allotted tries, resulting in a loss.
